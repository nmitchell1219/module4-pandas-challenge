# Pandas Challenge

This project involves analyzing school and standardized test data for the PyCity school district. Utilizing Pandas in Jupyter Notebook, I conducted a thorough analysis of district-wide standardized test results, including math and reading scores, to identify trends in school performance. 

# Written Report for PyCitySchools Analysis

The PyCitySchools analysis was conducted to assess the performance of schools across the district using a range of metrics such as average scores, passing percentages, and budget allocations. Data from several sources were consolidated and analyzed to give a comprehensive overview of the educational landscape in our district. This report summarizes the findings from the analysis and highlights key insights into how different factors like school spending, size, and type influence student performance.

## Key Findings and Observations

### District Overview<br>
:white_small_square:The district comprises a total of 15 schools serving 39,170 students.<br>
:white_small_square:The combined budget for these schools amounts to $$24,649,428.<br>
:white_small_square:On average, students achieved a math score of 78.985% and a reading score of 81.878%.<br>
:white_small_square:The percentage of students passing math was 74.98%, reading was 85.5%, and those passing both subjects was 65%.<br>

## School Performance<br>
:white_small_square:The analysis distinguished the schools into top-performing and low-performing categories based on the overall passing rate.
:white_small_square:Top schools tend to have higher budgets per student and smaller student populations.
:white_small_square:Conversely, schools struggling with performance show a trend of larger student bodies and lower spending per student.

## Conclusion and Recommendations

1. Investment in Resources<br>
:white_small_square:Schools with higher per-student budgets generally perform better. Increasing funding to lower-performing schools, particularly those with larger student bodies, could help bridge the performance gap.

2. Focus on Scalability<br>
:white_small_square: Smaller schools show better overall passing rates, suggesting that students benefit from a more focused educational environment. Initiatives to reduce class sizes in larger schools should be considered to replicate this success.
These findings provide actionable insights that can guide budgetary decisions, resource allocation, and policy-making to foster an improved educational environment across the district. It is recommended that the school board consider these factors in their strategic planning to enhance student outcomes district-wide.
