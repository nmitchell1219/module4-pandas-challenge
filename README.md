# Pandas Challenge

This project involves analyzing school and standardized test data for the PyCity school district. Utilizing Pandas in Jupyter Notebook, I conducted a thorough analysis of district-wide standardized test results, including math and reading scores, to identify trends in school performance. The insights derived from this analysis will guide informed decisions regarding future school budgets and priorities.
